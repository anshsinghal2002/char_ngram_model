# N-Gram Model for Language Identification

## Overview
This Python script implements n-gram models for language identification, with options for basic n-gram models and n-gram models with interpolation. The models are trained on a set of city names from different countries and are used to classify the language of new city names.

## Features
- Implementation of basic n-gram models and n-gram models with interpolation.
- Utility functions for creating n-grams, padding text, and training models.
- Evaluation of model performance based on perplexity and classification accuracy.
